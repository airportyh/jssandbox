# JS Sandbox

JS Sandbox yet another JavaScript sandbox akin to [jsbin](http://jsbin.com/), [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), and [Codepen](http://codepen.io/). The main philosophical difference of JS Sandbox vs those is more focus on debuggability, reproducibility, and simplicity. JS Sandbox will:

* preserve correct line numbers inside of stacktraces
* not insert or generate any code the author didn't write
* allow easy exporting of the source code as a zip file
